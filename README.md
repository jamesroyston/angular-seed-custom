# `tweaked angular-seed using mocha/chai/sinon and puppeteer`

Clone this whenever you want to bootstrap an AngularJS(1.x) project for experimentation or learning. For example, I needed this for quick sandbox environments without having to always switch jasmine for mocha, puppeteer for firefox, etc.

How to get started:
```
git clone https://github.com/jamesroyston/angular-seed-custom.git
npm i
npm start
```
Then navigate to http://localhost:8000/.
